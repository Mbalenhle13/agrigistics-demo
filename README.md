## Development server

## Code scaffolding

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.


# Challenges Faced

- The 'ngx-filter-pipe' does not work (which I've used many times before) however there seems to be some compatability issues with Angular 18 or perhaps my project set up. I was looking to create a custom filter before time ran out.
- It was challenging to attempt to match the styling to the Figma file within 3 hours (assuming that the 3 hours included project set up and code uploading to github), hence I prioritised functionality over design.
