# Challenges Faced

- Implementing the 'ngx-filter-pipe' for multiple columns. This functionalituy does not work exactly how I had intended creating a custom filter to search across multiple columns could have worked better.
- It was challenging to attempt to match the styling to the Figma file within 3 1/2 hours (assuming that the 3 1/2 hours included project set up and code uploading to github), hence I prioritised functionality over design.
